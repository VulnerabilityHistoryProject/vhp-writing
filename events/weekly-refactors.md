On the week of :nice_date:, :num_refactors: commits
mention the word "Refactor". Refactoring is the practice of improving
the maintainability of the code without changing its functionality.
Code is easier to secure when it is easier to maintain.

Problems can occur when refactoring is ignored for long periods of time.
Also, a lack of well-maintained unit tests can lead to refactoring
introducing unintended functionality changes.
