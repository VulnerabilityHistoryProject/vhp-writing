### Our first workshop! And new Zenodo updates

* We've held our first workshop, and we're in the process of testing out our process for bringing practitioners into the curation process
* New Zenodo integration! Now that we've merged all of our separate vulnerabilty repos into a single place, citing us in academic literature is much easier. If you ever need to cite us, use the DOI that is generated at [this page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7558231).
* Version 7.0 of the dataset! New commit information, new Django vulnerabilities.
