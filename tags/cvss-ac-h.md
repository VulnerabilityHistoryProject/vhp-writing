>  A successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the
>   attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or
>   execution against the
>    vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For
>    example, a successful attack may depend on an attacker overcoming any of the
>    following conditions:
>   * The attacker must gather knowledge about the environment in which the
>     vulnerable target/component exists. For example, a requirement to collect
>     details on target configuration settings, sequence numbers, or shared
>     secrets.
>   * The attacker must prepare the target environment to improve exploit
>     reliability. For example, repeated exploitation to win a race condition, or
>     overcoming advanced exploit mitigation techniques.
>   * The attacker must inject themselves into the logical network path between
>     the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or
>     modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack).

Vulnerabilities with this tag were given a CVSS rating as part of the requirement to be included into the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/). You can learn more about what the individual scores mean in the [CVSS specification document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).
