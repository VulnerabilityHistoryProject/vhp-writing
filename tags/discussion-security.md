Was there any discussion surrounding this as to whether or not this is a security issue?

A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to 
resolve uncertainty.

Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion. 
For example:
* "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
* "Ping" (reminding people)
