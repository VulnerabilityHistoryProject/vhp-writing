**You Aren't Going to Need It**

Developers will often speculate that they need more than what is necessary. Meant to point out a form of **over-engineering**, YAGNI is about simplifying your system. 

Simplicity is closely related to security. The more complex your task, the harder it is to see your mistakes. You want to look for *obviously no mistakes* instead of *no obvious mistakes*. 

These are vulnerabilities where the curators believe that a lesson to be learned here was related to YAGNI.
