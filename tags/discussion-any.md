Was there any discussion surrounding this vulnerability?

A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to 
resolve uncertainty.

Example include:
* Is this out of our scope?
* Is this a security problem?
* How should we fix this?

Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion. 
For example:
* "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
* "Ping" (reminding people)
