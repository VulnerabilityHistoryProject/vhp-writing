Did this vulnerability involve mishandling a complex input?

Vulnerabilities with this tag were flagged as an example of a recurring lesson in secure software engineering.

Historically, many vulnerabilities have occurred when a program like an expressive language, a deeply-nested structure, or an intricate compression algorithm. Embedded fonts, URLs, directory paths, video media, vector graphics, query strings, custom protocols, and raster graphics are just a few examples of
deceptively complex inputs that have led to vulnerabilities.
