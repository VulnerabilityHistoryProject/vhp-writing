Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

Example of checks can include:
* null pointer checks
* check the current role, e.g. root
* boundary checks for a number
* consult file permissions
* check a return value
