Did this have a lot of code ownership changes?

Vulnerabilities with this tag have had at least 10 changes in **ownership** over the lifetime of the vulnerable code. A code owner is a person who is in an [`OWNERS or CODEOWNERS`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) file that impacts the code. These are people who are tasked with being gatekeepers to the code, reviewing changes.

Frequent changes in ownership can result in loss of institutional knowledge. Thus, we tag vulnerabilities where the code had a lot of ownership changes.
