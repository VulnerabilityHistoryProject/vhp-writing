Vulnerabilities with this tag were given a CVSS rating as part of the requirement to be included into the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/). You can learn more about what the individual scores mean in the [CVSS specification document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document). 

Quote from the CVSS specification regarding Low Access Complexity:

>   This metric describes the conditions beyond the attackerâ€™s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. As described below, such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target, or computational exceptions. 
>   Importantly, the assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability (such conditions are captured in the User Interaction metric). 
>   If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. The Base Score is greatest for the least complex attacks.
>
>   Low: Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.
