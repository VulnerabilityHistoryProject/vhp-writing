Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system provides? 
    
A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features 
limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on 
access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the 
like.
