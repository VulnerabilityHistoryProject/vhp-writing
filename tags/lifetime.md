How long was this in the system?

The collection of **lifetime** measure the length of time between the earliest vulnerability-contributing commit (VCC) and the earliest fix commit. During this lifetime is when developers **missed** the vulnerability.

Our breakdown of vulnerability lifetimes are arbitrary. The categories are:

  * Less than 30 days
  * 30 to 90 days
  * 90 to 180 days
  * 180 days to 1 year
  * 1 to 2 years
  * 2 to 5 years
  * 5+ years
