Is this vulnerability an example of **defense in depth**?

Defense in Depth is a principle of cybersecurity that states that security mitigations need to exsist throughout the system, not just in single layers. 

Think of Defense in Depth like a medieval castle in England. Those castles were designed with defense in mind, adding some sort of defense at each layer. First there are hills and cliffs to scale, then a moat, multiple walls, and all types of defenses throughout. Even the final spiral staircase up to the King's bedroom will rotate in such a way that favors right-handed defenders at the top of the stairs.

Defense in Depth is a useful as an argument that, hard as we tried to secure the perimeter, we must assume that attackers got through and so we must focus on securing inner layers too.
