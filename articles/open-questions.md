title: We Love Open Questions

  Why do we talk about things that have not been "proven" in research?

  Because science is a work in progress. It is perpetually tentative. 

  Let's talk about some open questions that we've discovered via the Vulnerability History Project.

_You can't talk about that, it's not proven!_

If we waited for the evidence to be crystal clear, the state of the world would never improve. Software engineers knows this tension: you will always release buggy software. You can't wait for things to be perfect, because they never will be. Same with research.

We want this project to be a two-way street. We will talk about software security engineering research here, but we also want to _inspire_ research studies too.

Here is a list of open questions in software security engineering research:

* In what ways has [refactoring](/articles-refactoring) historically improved software security?
* Do developers have a blindspot for internationalization that leads to vulnerabilities?
* [How many people](/tags/cooks) should be working on the same code at the same time? And how should we accomplish that?

...and many more to come. We'll update this list as we develop this site!
