title: Beware of complex inputs
art: snowflake.jpg
blurb: |
  Many vulnerabilities have occurred when a program is trying to
  process input that involves complexity, like an expressive language,
  a deeply-nested structure, or an intricate compression algorithm.
  Embedded fonts, URLs, video media, vector graphics, query strings,
  custom protocols, and raster graphics are just a few examples of
  deceptively complex inputs that have led to vulnerabilities.
  
  Don't just think about code complexity, think about input complexity.
