title: Beware of complex inputs
art: snowflake.jpg
blurb: |
Many vulnerabilities have occurred when a program is trying to
process input that involves complexity, like an expressive language,
a deeply-nested structure, or an intricate compression algorithms.
Embedded fonts, URLs, video media, vector graphics, query strings,
custom protocols, and raster graphics are just a few examples of being
deceptively complex inputs that led to vulnerabilities.
