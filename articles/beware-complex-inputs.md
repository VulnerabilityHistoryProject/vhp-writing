Computers only understand numbers, so the ways in which we translate our inputs are quite elaborate.

Historically, many vulnerabilities have occurred when a program like an expressive language, a deeply-nested structure, or an intricate compression algorithm. Embedded fonts, URLs, directory paths, video media, vector graphics, query strings, custom protocols, and raster graphics are just a few examples of
deceptively complex inputs that have led to vulnerabilities.

How should we defend against complex inputs? Read more about input complexity and see some examples over at our tag, [:tag:](/tags/complex inputs).
