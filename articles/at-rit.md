At Rochester Institute of Technology we take cybersecurity very seriously. We believe that everyone needs to learn about security, not just security experts. 

That's why in the [**Department of Software Engineering**](https://www.se.rit.edu) we require every student to take our [_Engineering Secure Software_](https://www.se.rit.edu/~swen-331) course. In this course, we explore a myriad of engineering mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities. Every year, around 120 students take this course. The Vulnerability History Project is a two-way street with the classroom: what we learn in the classroom shows up here, and vice versa.

For students who want to become experts in all things cybsecurity, we have a whole department for that, too. The [Department of Computing Security](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computing-security) offers highly flexible major where students can focus on cybersecurity as it applies to penetration testing, networking, system administration, malware, cryptography, and all kinds of other security subdisciplines.

Finally, the [RIT Global Cybersecurity Institute](https://www.rit.edu/cybersecurity/) is our interdisciplinary resarch center for all things cybersecurity at RIT.
