blurb: |
  Random testing, also called fuzzing, is a widely-used technique for
  discovering bugs automatically. Fuzz testing programs will look for
  weaknesses by intelligently generating random inputs and executing
  the system repeatedly on those inputs.

  While quite useful for finding hard-to-reach bugs, fuzzing is only
  effective for finding certain kinds of vulnerabilities. See what kinds
  of vulnerabilities are found by fuzzers.
