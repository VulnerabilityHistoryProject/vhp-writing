title: Will this happen again?
art: broken
blurb: |
  Regressions happen. Code breaks over time. Automated testing, such as
  unit testing, can pay enormous dividends in preventing future regressions down the road.

  Yes, automation is expensive. But when we automate our tests, we
  can re-run them at any time to know when our product has regressed to
  a lower quality.

  Many vulnerabilities sit in places where no automated unit tests
  could be found. See some examples at [Lesson: Lacked Test](/tags/lacked-test).
