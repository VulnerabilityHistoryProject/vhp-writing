title: Will this happen again?

blurb: |
  Regressions happen. Code breaks over time. Automated testing, such as
  unit testing, can pay enormous dividends in preventing future regressions down the road.

  Many vulnerabilities sit in places where no automated unit tests
  could be found. See some examples at [Lesson: Lacked Test](/tags/lacked-test).
