Here's the old text for OWNERS files:

In many projects, an OWNERS file is placed in a directory of the repository with a list of usernames, or "owners".
An owner is someone who has the power to approve commits
in the code review system. They wield significant influence on the
project. Changes in code ownership can indicate team restructuring by
adopting new members or removing members.

Here's the old text for Reverts.

A single revert may not be an issue, but a long history of many reverts
could mean a breakdown in communication or a lack of agreement on design
or requirements.
